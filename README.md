# Local Set Up and Installation
To clone the application then change into the directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:Sun-Mountain/lettuceMeetApp.git
cd lettuceMeetApp
```

## Set Up Ruby on Rails Locally

The backend is built with Ruby on Rails with a [PostgreSQL](Postgres-url) database. OSX comes with Ruby already installed. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) can be used to install if necessary. For Windows, we recommend [Ruby Installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/).

**Recommended:** Install a ruby version manage like [RVM](https://rvm.io/).

Install and switch to the latest version of Ruby:

```
rvm install 3.0.0
rvm use 3.0.0
```

Homebrew can be used to install postgresql:

```
brew install postgresql
```

Follow the prompts following installation to start running postgres as a service. For postgresql clients, we recommend [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) or [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html).

### Set Up Ruby on Rails App
Install bundler:

1. `gem install bundler --no-document`
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `rails db:create db:migrate` to set up the database.

### Run the Server

```
rails s
```

The backend will be running by default on `http://localhost:3000` and the server will be running on port `5432`.

## Frontend (VueJS)

In another terminal, change into the frontend directory:

1. Install package manager `yarn install`
2. Run frontend `yarn serve`

In a browser, go to `http://localhost:8080/` to go to the application.

# Testing

TBA

# Contributing

This is an open source application. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new feature or changes

We use github to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Request Steps

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Add tests where necessary.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Use a Consistent Coding style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs

## Report Bugs with Github [Issues](https://github.com/Sun-Mountain/lettuceMeetApp/issues)

Bugs are a reality of code and we appreciate people finding and reporting them in our app.

**Bug Reports Should Include:**

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
