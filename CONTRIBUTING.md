Thank you for considering contributing to LettuceMeetApp.

You can contribute in the following ways:

## Bug Reports
Bug reports and feature suggestions must use descriptive and concise titles and but submitted thru [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Sun-Mountain/lettuceMeetApp/issues). Please use the search function to make sure that you are not submitting duplicates, and that a similar report or request has not already been resolved or rejected.

## Pull Requests
We use commit squashing, so the final commit in the main branch will carry the title of the pull request, and commits from the main branch are fed into the release notes.

**Pull Requests that do not pass automated checks may not be reviewed.**

## Documentation
We use the wiki for our documentation. You can make requests by opening a blank issue with `Documentation` in the title.
